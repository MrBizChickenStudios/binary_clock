## Features

- **Real-Time Binary Clock**: Displays time in binary format using lights for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Flashing Separators**: Blinking lights act as separators between hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Pygame-Based GUI**: A smooth graphical interface built using the Pygame library.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjust light colors, size, and screen dimensions through constants.
